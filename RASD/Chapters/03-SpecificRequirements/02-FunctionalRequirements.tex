    \item Users who receive the notification about this approval process are then asked to approve or reject the report
    \item The report is validated if and only if the algebraic sum of approvals (+1) and rejection (-1) is at least $v$
\end{itemize}

    \item A user has access to the type and amount of violations that happened
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Allow authorities to see data about violations and who committed them}
