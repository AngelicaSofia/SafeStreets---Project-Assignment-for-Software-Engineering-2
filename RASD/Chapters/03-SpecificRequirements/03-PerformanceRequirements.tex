\subsection{Reliability}
\subsubsection{Index MTBF}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 90\% of all response time should be less than 4.5 second
    \item The response times will be measured using HP LoadRunner (or similar tool) located behind the firewall and in front of the web servers
    \item Backend response times will be measured using the application server log files
    \item The system is provided to serve a huge number of users in parallel
    \item At the beginning the system is supposed to be correctly and quickly responding to 100'000 users
    \item As number of users is expected to be grown linearly, the system is provided of a flexible structure, to adapt to further number of requests
    \item Daily tests to check performance will be executed to guarantee the service
    \item The performance tests should not exceed 50\% CPU utilization during the execution time
\end{itemize}
