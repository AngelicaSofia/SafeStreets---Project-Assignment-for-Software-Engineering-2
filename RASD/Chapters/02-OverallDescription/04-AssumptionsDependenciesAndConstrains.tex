\section{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}

\subsection{Domain assumption}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Personal information that a visitor has to provide to become a registered user are name, surname, email, ID number and password
    \item Emails are unique and a user can only be associated to one email address
    \item After registration the system sends an email to the user containing a recap of the information they provided and an activation link
    \item Once the activation link is opened in a browser the email address of the user is verified and the user is automatically logged in
    \item Two-factors authentication can be enabled by the user by providing a phone number (SMS authentication) or by scanning a QR Code with an authenticator app (Token authentication)
    \item Once logged in a user can notify traffic violations
    \item Pictures with a resolution of less than 2MP are automatically rejected
    \item Users can view a custom map that is updated periodically and shows unsafe streets by highlighting them with a gradient of colors from yellow to red which indicates the level of danger
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The authorities will be in charge of every effective measure of security taken to make streets safer
  \end{itemize}
