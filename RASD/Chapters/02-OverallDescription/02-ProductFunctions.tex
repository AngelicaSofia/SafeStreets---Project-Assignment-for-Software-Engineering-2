\section{Product Functions}
The following section contains the main product functions of SafeStreets. Some of them are available to everyone, some only to registered users and others only to authorities.

  \subsection{Show safe and unsafe areas}
  \begin{description}
    \item \textbf{Who has access:} \newline Anyone
    \item \textbf{Description:} \newline SafeStreets helps people understand which parts of their town, or any customizable region, are more dangerous because of traffic violations. A map highlights areas differently according to the frequency and severity of violations that occur. The data used to build these statistics is both entered by SafeStreets users and, whenever possible, integrated by data provided by the municipality.
  \end{description}

  \subsection{Submit and confirm violations}
  \begin{description}
    \item \textbf{Who has access:} \newline Registered users
    \item \textbf{Description:} \newline SafeStreets core functionality is allowing users to submit documentation about traffic violations they see. Only registered users have access to this functionality because it is necessary to be able to connect a report to the person who filed it, as intentionally filing fake reports may have legal consequences. In order to keep fake reports to a minimum, all violations need to be approved by an established amount of SafeStreets users and only then are they shown to the authorities. The ratio of approved versus non approved reports of a user, as well as the actual amount of violations they reported, is also taken into account when computing the reliability of a user.

  \subsection{Allow authorities to take action}
  \begin{description}
    \item \textbf{Who has access:} \newline Registered authorities
    \item \textbf{Description:} \newline Authorities have access to another section of SafeStreets, which allows them to see more data about who submitted and committed violations. They can check the latest reports and either send a patrol in the area or, if the violations respects certain requirements, even directly send tickets to the culprit.
