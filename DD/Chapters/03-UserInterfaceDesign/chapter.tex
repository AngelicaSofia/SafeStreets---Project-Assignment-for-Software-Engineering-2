\section{User Interface Design}

The design of the web application will use the Google Material UI elements to give out a more native look on
Android Devices, which we expect to be the majority of our user base.
The design of the native applications will, instead, comply with the target platform. This process will be handled
by the framework (e.g. Ionic framework) we'll use to port the Web App to Android and iOS.

In the following pages some mock ups are provided with a description of how the user will interact with them.
