\section{Scope}
SafeStreets is a service that is available to any citizen having a valid ID number.
The service creates a direct channel to communicate with authorities and with other users about the observed traffic violations, promoting street safety and
helping others who might be in need, for example by reporting a vehicle which is blocking an access for disabled people.
Registered users can submit reports that are going to be validated by other end-users, creating a network of trust.
The reports they file provide information about the violation, the location and the license plate of the subject. This makes reports detailed enough for
approval by public officers, who are able to review them and take proper action to discourage further infractions.
