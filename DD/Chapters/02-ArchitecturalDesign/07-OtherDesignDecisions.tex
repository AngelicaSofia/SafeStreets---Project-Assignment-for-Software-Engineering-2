\subsection{Algorithm for generating possible interventions}
This algorithm is used to automatically generate possible interventions in response to certified violations, in order to 
prevent them. It is an algorithm that uses the principles of Machine Learning and started from an input of a $b$ GB of text, 
extracted from $n$ (order of thousands) web pages. It has also in input some parameters; particularly, it is focused on 
keywords. It takes as the main keywords the ones taken from the category of certified violation, provided by the user, 
then as auxiliary keywords, to be used if the collected material in the first step is not sufficient, the ones taken from 
the brief description inserted by the user in the report. Thanks to this information a simple and middle-length text 
suggesting possible interventions is produced with a procedure similar to algorithm GPT-2.
