\section{Overview}

The implementation of the different features will follow a priority list. This way
we can schedule the development process and make adjustments on less important aspects of
the platform to better fit the key functionalities it will offer.

We identified the following features and assigned to them a priority based on the importance
it will have for our customers and an expected time of implementation and graphic design:
